# CR-10-SKR-mini-v3-e3-
This is a Klipper and Marlin setup that i have made for my CR-10. 
My CR-10 is upgraded with the folowing:
1-SKR mini v3 e3.
2-BBT smart filament runout sensor (you will have to edit the code if you dont have one ).
3-Duel Z axes (the current is set to 1.3A , if you have a single Z motor set it between 0.530-0.680 Amps).
4-BTT UPS (this doesn't work on Klipper unfortunately, and from my test  it might work with a Class 10 SDcard but i haven't tried that) 
I didn't have time to do long tests but from what i tried everything works as intended .
